MotionSphere - C# Version
MotionSphere is a Unity-based project developed as part of the Visuo-Kinesthetic Synesthesia research conducted by the VE Lab. This project focuses on motion recognition and aims to provide an immersive environment that integrates visual and proprioceptive feedback for training and research purposes.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
MotionSphere leverages advanced motion recognition techniques to analyze user movements in real-time. The system is designed to work seamlessly with Unity, providing a flexible platform for creating interactive training programs and research tools.

This project is a continuation of VE Lab's ongoing efforts to explore the intersection of vision and kinesthesia, fostering deeper understanding and practical applications in areas such as rehabilitation, sports training, and human-computer interaction.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Real-Time Motion Recognition: Tracks and analyzes user movements in 3D space using a spherical coordinate system.
Spherical Visualization: Visualizes motion paths on a virtual sphere to enhance understanding and feedback.
Customizable Training Scenarios: Supports the creation of bespoke motion-based tasks for research or practical training.
Unity Integration: Designed to work natively with Unity, ensuring ease of use and flexibility for developers.
